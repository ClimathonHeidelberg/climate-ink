# Tipping Points

Melting Antarctic and Greenland ice shield will probably be irreversible at 1.5°-2° temperature increase (compared to pre-industrial levels).

currently: global sea level rises at a pace of nearly four millimetres per year

disappearance of the Greenland ice sheet would occur over a period of several millennia due to increased melting of the ice sheet
